## Database Structure

### Data Files Location
`Dataset/archive/`
- `medicine.csv` - All medicines with brand names, generics, prices
- `generic.csv` - Generic information with indications, drug classes
- `manufacturer.csv` - Pharmaceutical companies
- `indication.csv` - Medical conditions
- `drug class.csv` - Therapeutic classifications

### Medicine Search Logic
1. **By Generic Name**: Exact and partial matching
2. **By Indication**: Searches generic indications and descriptions
3. **Combined**: Merges results and removes duplicates
4. **Ranking**: Prioritizes exact matches over partial matches

## Safety & Disclaimers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Medical Disclaimers

1. **Not a Replacement for Medical Judgment**
   - This is a clinical decision support tool
   - Final prescribing decisions must be made by licensed physicians
   - Always conduct complete patient evaluation

2. **Verify Before Prescribing**
   - Check patient allergies
   - Review current medications for interactions
   - Verify contraindications
   - Consider patient-specific factors (age, renal/hepatic function, pregnancy)

3. **Data Accuracy**
   - Medicine database is web-scraped and should be verified
   - Prices and availability may change
   - Always confirm with current pharmaceutical references

4. **Legal Responsibility**
   - Prescribing physician retains full legal responsibility
   - System provides suggestions, not prescriptions
   - Document clinical reasoning for all prescriptions

## Technical Implementation

### Medicine Database Utility
Located at: `app/lib/medicineDatabase.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `searchMedicinesByGeneric(genericNames: string[])`
- `searchMedicinesByIndication(indications: string[])`
- `searchMedicinesCombined(genericNames, indications)`
- `getTopMedicines(results, limit)`

### Caching
- CSV data is cached in memory after first load
- Improves performance for subsequent searches
- Cache clears on server restart

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if data files not found
- Returns empty arrays instead of crashing
- Logs errors to console for debugging

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. ‚úÖ **Price comparison** between different brands
2. ‚úÖ **Alternative medicine suggestions** (same generic, different brands)
3. üìã **Drug interaction checker**
4. üìã **Dosage calculator** based on patient weight/age
5. üìã **Stock availability** integration with pharmacies
6. üìã **Generic substitution recommendations**
7. üìã **Cost-effective alternatives**
8. üìã **Prescription formatting and printing**

## Troubleshooting

### No medicines found
- Check if Dataset folder exists in project root
- Verify CSV files are in `Dataset/archive/`
- Check console for parsing errors
- Ensure generic names are spelled correctly

### Slow performance
- First search loads CSV data (may take 1-2 seconds)
- Subsequent searches use cache (fast)
- Limit results to improve response time

### Inaccurate matches
- Use more specific generic names
- Add multiple indications for better matching
- Review GPT's extracted data in structuredData field

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify OpenAI API key is configured
3. Ensure Dataset files are accessible
4. Review API response for error messages
