To change model:
```typescript
model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', // Change this line
```

### **Batch Analysis**

Generate all analyses at once:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {

  body: JSON.stringify({
    conversation,
    analysisTypes: ['summary', 'symptoms', 'diagnosis', 'prescription', 'follow-up']
  })
});
```
